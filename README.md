# Binomial Distribution Calculator
In this project, a computer program was developed that creates a histogram for a binomial distribution and calculates both the individual and cumulative probability, expected value, and standard deviation of the Bernoulli chain. It was specifically developed for application in the realm of statistical combination, particularly for the analysis of probability experiments.
